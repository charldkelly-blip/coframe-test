I redesigned the hero section into a modern split-screen layout, with one half showing a full-height image and the other half focused on the content. This gives the page a more premium, contemporary feel compared to the older design. With the logo, headline, benefits, and CTA clearly laid out on the right, visitors get the key message instantly while also connecting with a strong visual impressionâ€”making the experience clearer, more professional, and more likely to convert.
